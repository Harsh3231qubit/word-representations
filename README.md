  ## ðŸ“„ Description

  * This repo contains code written in google colab.
  * The colab file includes implementation of skip gram model in
    pytorch.
  * It also includes testing of model on a small synthetic dataset.
  * My model worked ok but not so good due to less number of  dimensions
    and small data.
